The Method of Finite Elements (FEM) is extreamly useful in numericaly solving
differential equations. We examine the use casses for partial differential
equations on a provided boundary condition. This means that our algorithms, and
mathematics must be mostly independent of the boundaries and the conditions at
the boundaries.
