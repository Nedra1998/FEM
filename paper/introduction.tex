The Finite Element Method(FEM) is a numerical solution for solving partial
differential equations with complex boundary conditions. The finite element
method generates a system of algebraic solutions approximating the solution to
the partial differential equation problem. The general premise of the method is
to divide the domain into a set of finite elements. The problem is then solved
for each of the finite elements, then the global solution can be found by
combining the solutions to all the finite elements.
