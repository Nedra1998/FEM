Using the algorithmic method for constructing an approximate solution to the
linear system, we can now construct our final approximation of $T$. By
substituting the values of $T_j$ into the equation (\ref{eq:lin_approx}), we
find that our approximation is
\begin{align}\label{eq:approx}
  T_h=\sum_{j=1}^NT_j\varphi_j.
\end{align}
where $T_j$ was solved for from the system of equations, and $\varphi_j$ is the
global basis function corresponding to the $j$th vertex of the element mesh.
