\label{sec:dirichlet_boundary_conditions}

Now that the global system of equations has been constructed, we are able to
impose the predefined boundary conditions to the system of equations. As
discussed previously, we will only consider the Dirichlet boundary conditions
in this explination.

The global system of equations can be written as
\begin{align*}
   G\partial_t U=MU+F.
\end{align*}
