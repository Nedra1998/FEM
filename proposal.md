# 1

The primary learning objective is to learn and understand the mathematics of
the finite element method. This is a method of numerical approximation used in
differential equations. This builds off the of Math 305 course I took last
year. This I will program an implementation of the method.

# 2

My responsibilities are to read the textbook (The Mathematics Theory of Finite
Element Methods, by Susanne C. Brenner and L. Ridgway Scott), then be able to
understand and communicate the information in weekly presentations to Paul.
Using the information that I have gained I will program an implementation of a
finite element method, that solves serveral classical PDEs.

# 3

I will meet and discuss the project with my faculty sponsor weekly, and
feedback will be provided on those regular meetings. My performance will be
evaluated by my understanding of the mathematics, and the quality of the
program that I develop.

# 4

I will demonstrate what I have learned in both a verbal presentation, and in
the final product of the code allong with a final paper that docuents the code
and the mathematical theory. The final code will be due near the end of the
independent study.

# 5

We have arranged to meet weekly on Thursday morning, then we are also able to
communicate over email. Does it work? Hello Why is it not updating?
